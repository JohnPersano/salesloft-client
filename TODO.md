* Virtualize the frequency count list
* Investigate expected data load of client and discuss server side caching of calculated data with team
* Add more sensible Cypress integration/customer acceptance tests
* Use Levenshtein distance for calculating the duplicate email addresses
* Make the table more generic and reusable (create heading and row components)
